CentraleSupélec is a public institution under ministerial charter, devoted to the sciences and engineering. This charter is shared between the Ministry of Higher Education,  Research and Innovation, and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Digital Technologies. CentraleSupélec was officially established on January 1st, 2015, bringing together two leading engineering schools in France; Ecole Centrale Paris and Supélec. The co-operation between our two grandes écoles, as they are known in the French system, had progressively been gaining momentum since 2009, with sustained alliance in three core areas: engineering education, executive education and research.
